## Stakeholders

Interviewer: Lily Fu

Stakeholder: Aaron Duan, Senior in Stern Finance

**Summary of Goals/Needs:**

- The app should provide a clear and simple way to check printer status (e.g., online/offline, paper/ink levels).

- Users should be able to locate the nearest available printer based on their current location.

- Allow users to submit printer maintenance requests remotely.

- Allow users to submit print requests remotely and pick up their documents later.

- Provide notifications when a job is completed or if there's an issue with printing.

- Option to track past print jobs and costs.

**Summary of Problems/Frustrations:**

- Users often walk to a printer only to find it out of service or paper/ink.

- Some printers are in hidden locations or are always busy.

- Users cannot find a way to report the issue of a printer.

- Users must be physically at the printer to start a job, which is inconvenient.

- Users don’t know when their print jobs are ready or if an issue occurred.

## Product Vision Statement

BigPrints empowers students and staff at NYU with a seamless on-campus printing experience by enabling access to every printer’s features and location, as well as real-time availability, traffic and maintenance status, and progress of the user’s print jobs.

As a maintenance staff member, I want to receive real-time notifications of printer issues, so I can prioritize and fix problems efficiently.

As a student, I want to notify maintenance when a printer is out of paper, so I can continue printing without delays.

As a student, I want to see an estimated wait time for a busy printer, so I can decide whether to wait or choose another one.

As a student, I want to filter printers by distance so that I can decide which printer I should go to to save time.

As a student, I want to filter printers by availability, so I can quickly find a free one to use.
