**Summary of Goals/Needs:**

- The app should provide a clear and simple way to check printer status (e.g., online/offline, paper/ink levels).

- Users should be able to locate the nearest available printer based on their current location.

- Allow users to submit printer maintenance requests remotely.

- Allow users to submit print requests remotely and pick up their documents later.

- Provide notifications when a job is completed or if there's an issue with printing.

- Option to track past print jobs and costs.

**Summary of Problems/Frustrations:**

- Users often walk to a printer only to find it out of service or paper/ink.

- Some printers are in hidden locations or are always busy.

- Users cannot find a way to report the issue of a printer

- Users must be physically at the printer to start a job, which is inconvenient.

- Users donâ€™t know when their print jobs are ready or if an issue occurred.
