## Stakeholders

Interviewer: Lily Fu

Stakeholder: Aaron Duan, Senior in Stern Finance

**Summary of Goals/Needs:**

- The app should provide a clear and simple way to check printer status (e.g., online/offline, paper/ink levels).

- Users should be able to locate the nearest available printer based on their current location.

- Allow users to submit printer maintenance requests remotely.

- Allow users to submit print requests remotely and pick up their documents later.

- Provide notifications when a job is completed or if there's an issue with printing.

- Option to track past print jobs and costs.

**Summary of Problems/Frustrations:**

- Users often walk to a printer only to find it out of service or paper/ink.

- Some printers are in hidden locations or are always busy.

- Users cannot find a way to report the issue of a printer.

- Users must be physically at the printer to start a job, which is inconvenient.

- Users donâ€™t know when their print jobs are ready or if an issue occurred.

## User Requirements

As a teaching assistant, I want to see which printer is available so that I can print out a large amount of exams.

As a professor, I want to see which printer supports color printing so that I can print out colored handouts.

As a printer user, I want to see how many credits I have left so that I can recharge my printing credits at any time.

As a student, I want to be able to report malfunctions of the printer so that I can get help immediately if the printer is broken.

As a student, I want to see instructions for self-debugging small malfunctions so that I can solve minor issues and not delay my print tasks.
