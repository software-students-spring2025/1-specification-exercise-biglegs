## Stakeholders

## Product Vision Statement

BigPrints empowers students and staff at NYU with a seamless on-campus printing experience by enabling access to every printer’s features and location, as well as real-time availability, traffic and maintenance status, and progress of the user’s print jobs.

## User Requirements

1. As a teaching assistant, I want to see which printer is available so that I can print out a large amount of exams.

2. As a professor, I want to see which printer supports color printing so that I can print out colored handouts.

3. As a printer user, I want to see how many credits I have left so that I can recharge my printing credits at any time.

4. As a student, I want to be able to report malfunctions of the printer so that I can get help immediately if the printer is broken.

5. As a maintenance staff member, I want to receive real-time notifications of printer issues, so I can prioritize and fix problems efficiently.

6. As a student, I want to notify maintenance when a printer is out of paper, so I can continue printing without delays.

7. As a student, I want to see an estimated wait time for a busy printer, so I can decide whether to wait or choose another one.

8. As a student, I want to filter printers by distance so that I can decide which printer I should go to to save time.

9. As a student, I want to filter printers by availability, so I can quickly find a free one to use.

10. As a student, I want to receive real-time updates on my print job status, so I know when it is completed or if there is an issue.
